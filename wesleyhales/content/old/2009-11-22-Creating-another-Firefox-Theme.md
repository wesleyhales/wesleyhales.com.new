title: Creating (another) Firefox Theme
tags: [Java, firefox]
preview: After creating the ANTHEM Firefox theme, I decided to start on another. This one was never published to the Mozilla extensions repo, but it's worth blogging about :)

<p>I started laying down ideas for a new Firefox theme a few months ago and this is what emerged. I'm not sure why I can't stay away from the darker themes. Maybe it's the richness that black (and darker colors) allows on a monitor, but I tried to stay as far away from mainstream design on this as I could. I have already coded this into a downloadable theme, but I am still working out some glitches. Then I have to let it sit in the Mozilla incubator, as I did with ANTHEM.</p> 
<p>Speaking of ANTHEM, I'm quite surprised that it has done so well. 780k downloads and counting in 1 year. But it is all in vain if I can't "supply more blood" to this living organ (As <a href="http://www.jroller.com/robwilliams/">Rob W.</a> likes to put it.) With that said, I'm thinking about starting an open source project for these themes, because quite honestly, I don't have time to <a href="http://www.jroller.com/wesleyhales/entry/creating_a_firefox_3_theme">fix the bugs</a>. Anybody wanna help? Comment with your email...</p>

<p>I have been a bit indecisive about the the background on the toolbar on this one. What do you think? The first one at the top, or this one... </p>
