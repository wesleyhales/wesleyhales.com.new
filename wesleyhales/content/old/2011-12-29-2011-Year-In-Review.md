Overall I want to thank the people who have supported me and helped me achieve these things. There are too many to list, but you know who you are. I’m starting to realize that technology and trends are irrelevant. The thing that matters most are the people and communities behind them.  

2011 has been a mind blowing year and I’m looking forward to topping it in 2012.
