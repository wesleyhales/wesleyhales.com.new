<p>InfoQ just published the first in a series of 3 articles for the JBoss Portlet Bridge. The author of this series did an unbelievable job. I could write a whole post about how great his article(s) are, but I would hate to loose sight of this post topic :-) heh - just kidding... the author is me!</p>

<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/jsf-ajax-seam-portlets-pt-1"><img src="/images/jroller/infoq-thumb.jpg" alt=""/></a> 

<p>This first part is about basic JSF development with an easy to follow tutorial and real world development tips. The next one will be about RichFaces and the final (about Seam) will be published right after the release of Beta 4 in early September.</p> 

<p>Enjoy!<br/>
