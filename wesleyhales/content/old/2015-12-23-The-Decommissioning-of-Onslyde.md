preview: With the dawn of 2016, I'm putting one of my dearest and longest running open source projects, Onslyde, to rest.

As a creator and overseer of an Open Source project, we must make tough decisions on when to pull the plug and move on. In 2012,
I started a web based, real-time feedback project called [Onslyde](http://wesleyhales.com/blog/2013/02/25/How-Collective-Wisdom-Shapes-a-Talk/).

To me the project was a huge success with many measurable results: 

* Massive amount of research with WebSockets and mobile devices.
* Based on the code and research I was able to craft many talks for speaking engagements at conferences around the globe.
* The Onslyde service was used at some of the most popular software engineering conferences. (e.g. EdgeConf 2013-2014)
* I received an incredible job offer that I unfortunately had to turn down this time last year. massive salary, director title, bonus, everything...

All of the above and much more were the result of an open source side project on github. Of course, I had a few big fails
 along the way but overall I feel the project did something special that no one else was doing. It connected the audience with the
 conversation that has always been a one way lecture.

Anywho, here's to a great (almost) 4 year run for a project that I actually enjoyed working on. I may take the wisdom and lessons 
learned to a new similar project in 2016, so stay tuned.
