<p>So my current design is serving the purpose, but it seems a little "bland". I finally nailed down a design that is a little more frameworked. What I mean is, most of the time websites are designed to serve the content at hand. Which is fine in most cases, but I am looking for something more than just a "nice look" out of my designs. For some reason I can't get away from grey and other neutral colors. Maybe cause it's just the trend right now, but it seems to work and no matter what other colors I try in my designs, I always come back to grey. Also, the graphite pattern on the banner is kind of in style now (although it has been for the past 6 months), but by the time I code the css for this and integrate it into jroller - it will be time to do another design ?!?!</p> 
<div style="width:100%; text-align:center;"> 
<a href="src="/images/jroller/new-layout2.jpg"><img src="src="/images/jroller/new-layout2_small.jpg" alt=""/></a> 
</div>
