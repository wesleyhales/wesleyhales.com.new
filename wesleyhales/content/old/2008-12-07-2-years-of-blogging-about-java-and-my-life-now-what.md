<p>It has been 2 years since I decided to write my first blog post and I am pretty happy I did so. When I first tossed the idea around about it (and this was back in 2006) I was thinking, man, blogging is so 2002 and why would anybody want to read about stuff I'm doing. But much to my surprise, starting a blog is one of the best things I could've done. Much better than joining any social network by far, and much better than thinking future employers will take my resume at face value.</p> 
<p>This year has been incredible, moving so fast that I have hardly had time to sit back and reflect. With around 30,000 total unique visitors since this time last year, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wesleyhales/?anchor=richfaces_loading_modal_with_a4j">a4j:status</a>, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wesleyhales/?anchor=maven_2_vs_ant_revisited">maven vs ant</a>, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wesleyhales/?anchor=jsf_component_developmment_with_the">richfaces cdk</a>, <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wesleyhales/?anchor=converting_xhtml_to_pdf_or">xhtml to pdf</a>, and <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/wesleyhales/?anchor=running_seam_2_0_on">seam tomcat</a> are the top 5 keywords driving traffic.
