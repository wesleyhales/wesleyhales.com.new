<div style="padding:5px; margin:5px; background-color:#f9f5ae; border:1px solid #b2ac4f;">**UPDATE - This theme is now available on Mozilla.org here: <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9627/" style="color:#20aa30">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9627/</a></div>

<p>I decided to tryout Firefox theme building a few weeks ago on vacation. It took me a few days to design the skin and slice up all the images for theme creation. But once it came to laying down the Firefox CSS, I have to say that I was a little overwhelmed and haven't been back to finish the theme since.</p> 
<p>Of course this could be due to me actually having a day job and somewhat of a life. I think the overall css code for the layout is fairly simple. All you have to do is get your x,y coordinates right and you are golden. If anybody has any quick tips to make the process of placing the buttons a little simpler, please speak now! Or if someone wants to take on the task of completing this theme I will post the .psd files.</p>

<p>One of the cooler things about this theme is that the icons are 100% original. We all know most themes take some form of Windows or *nix icons. I tried to take the old 1930's cinema approach where I could. But I couldn't come up with anything for the copy and paste buttons (C and V).</p>
