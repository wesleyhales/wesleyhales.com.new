<p><p>July 1st marked my first day on the <a href="http://www.jboss.org/richfaces">JBoss RichFaces</a> team. I've decided to push myself and get out of my comfort zone. It seems that a developer only has so many years that he or she can sustain the same position doing the same thing and dealing with the same technology.</p><p>I’ve been with Red Hat almost 4 years now and have enjoyed every second of it, and this is the first time in my career that I have chosen the position for myself while working within a company. It’s usually the other way around - as you are either picked for your skills and talent to work on a specific team or for whatever reason you are just told to move to another team.</p><p>As for my new position, I have been designated to serve on JBoss’ mobile working group (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_team">Tiger Team</a>). I will be part time on the actual RichFaces project (making the project work on mobile devices) and the other part heavily focused on HTML5 and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Web">Mobile Web</a>. This is a new frontier for developers as we try to create HTML5/CSS3 based web apps that not only match the native app feel but also answer the question “How can we make the mobile web faster using JBoss middleware?”.</p><p>As things grow, so will the project and the team. I find excitement in bringing grass roots projects <a href="http://www.jboss.org/portletbridge">from nothing into full blown enterprise supported products</a> <img src="http://www.jroller.com/images/smileys/wink.gif" class="smiley" alt=";)" title=";)" /> Luckily I was in the right place at the right time and I must say that it was quite an honor to be allowed to make such a move. I’m looking forward to making good stuff happen.</p></p> 

<p>Stay tuned&#8230;</p>
