<p>I got one of those "tech support" phone calls from a family member this weekend, asking if I could help him undelete some files that were deleted by some ghost that snuck into his office ;) You gotta love it when people say they have no idea how an entire folder got deleted and they swear they've been hacked.</p> 
<p>So I scoured the web to see what exists. For *nix based utils, I think <A href="http://www.sleuthkit.org/">sleuthkit</a> with the autopsy forensics browser is the best out there (that's open source).</p> 
<p>But of course this user was on a Windows box. I finally found a really nice free tool for recovering files from NTFS. <a href="http://ntfsundelete.com/">NTFSUndelete</a> does exactly what the titles says. Saved the day for me and the person who "got hacked" ;) </p> 
<p>One other really cool forensics tool I ran across was <a href="http://www.e-fense.com/products.php">Helix</a> from a company called e-fence. This is really powerful stuff and the guys from hak5 actually did a <a href="http://www.hak5.org/episodes/episode-413">segment</a> on how to use the tool in one of their episodes.</p>
