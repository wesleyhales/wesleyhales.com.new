This is my first open source project so I am pretty stoked about it. Now I just have to keep myself from getting burnt-out ;).

<a href="http://labs.jboss.com/portal/developers/join">This article</a> from Jboss' CTO is really interesting and well stated about joining open source projects. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to join a community/project.
