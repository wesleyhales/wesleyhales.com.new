<p><p>So I made it over the hump of this mobile design week of madness. Below you will find a dark theme with a component skin for the rich:accordion component.</p><p><br /> 
<p class="pTitle">Day 3: About The Design</p><br /> 
Here we have another phone based design broke out into 3 pages.<br /> 
<a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG">The first page</a> is a standard menu so not much to say there. The bottom menu bar is a little different from <a href="http://www.wesleyhales.com/entry/going_mobile_with_richfaces_we">my first design</a> &#8211; following the lead of the native twitter iPhone app.<br /> 
<a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG"><img alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" src="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page1.JPG"/></a><br /> 
</p><br /> 
<p><br /> 
As you can see with the <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG">second page</a> (below), this is not a standard accordion panel type of component. When you touch an option from page one, the accordion expands on a different page and only focuses on that specific panel. Not sure if it could work, but accordion collapse/expand style of components don&#8216;t make a ton of sense to me on limited screen real estate.<br /> 
<a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG"><img style="margin:0 7px 0 0;" alt="RichFace Mobile Skin1" src="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page2.JPG"/></a><br /> 
</p><br /> 
<p><br /> 
So after you go through the menu options and decide on a component, you are taken to the <a href="/images/jroller/rf.phone.day3.page3.JPG">detail/demo screen</a>(below) where you can play around with your component of choice.</p> 

<p>Note the small orange page marker dots at the bottom. The user would have the ability to flip through each component in the given section by swiping horizontally.<br />
