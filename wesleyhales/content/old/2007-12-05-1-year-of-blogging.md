<p>Today marks my 1 year anniversary of blogging. I started this blog to basically express my views and opinions, to give back to the open source community of whom so much has been taken, and for job credibility.</p> 
<p>Trying to write good articles is a lot of work. Sure anybody can write about a few buzzwords and get some hits, but an article with substance and that actually helps someone through a use case or problem is where the satisfaction comes from.</p> 
<p>I started using Google analytics on this blog around the first of October, and here are my stats since then: 
<ul> 
<li>4,835 Visits</li> 
<li>2,493 Absolute Unique Visitors</li> 
<li>7,112 Pageviews</li> 
<li>1.47 Average Pageviews</li> 
<li>00:01:39 Time on Site</li> 
<li>79.23% Bounce Rate</li> 
<li>47.22% New Visits</li> 
</ul> 

Not too bad for a 2 month time span, but what really matters is getting comments that ask questions or suggestions that add to the article's value.
