<p>I guess everybody has a place a few hours from home that they can go and relax and enjoy nature. One rednecktastic place I like to go is at the foothills of the Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. Gatlinburg is a trip, and if you like <a href="http://www.dollyparton.com/">Dolly Parton</a>, well this is the place for you.</p>

<p>I mainly enjoy the fresh mountain air, the beautiful scenery, and the below freezing temps at night. My wife and I usually rent a cabin on a mountain top and watch the time drift by for a few days.</p>

<p>There is something cool about this place, It's just one of those things where you have to be here to know what I'm talking about. Anyway, it's nice to get away to a secluded place and collect your thoughts and think of innovative new ideas (All while eating funnel cake and watching your wife buy all kinds of "usefull/less" trinkets and decorations for Christmas ;)</p>
