<p>It has been quite a while in the making (a couple months) and we finally have a beta release of the portlet bridge.</p> 
<p>The JBoss Portlet Bridge is an implementation of the JSR-301 specification to support JSF within a portlet and with added enhancements to support other web frameworks. Currently the bridge supports any combination of JSF, Seam, and RichFaces to run inside a portlet.</p>
