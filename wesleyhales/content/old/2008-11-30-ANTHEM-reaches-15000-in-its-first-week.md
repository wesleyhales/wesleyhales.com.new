<p>I recently created a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9627">Firefox 3 theme</a> out of curiosity and because I love to try new things that deal with design. Much to my surprise, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/9627">ANTHEM</a> has been receiving a lot of attention over the past week since it has been released publicly on Mozilla.org. ANTHEM is named so because I consider it a hymn of praise or loyalty to my worshipful savior <a href="http://www.allaboutgod.com/how-to-be-saved.htm">Jesus Christ</a>. I also consider it dedicated to my newborn son, my wonderful wife, and the woman who raised me to be the man I am, my beautiful mother. I know, it may sound funny that I am using a Firefox theme for all of this, and I tend to keep my religious/personal views out of the work place, but I always tell God "...the more fame I receive, I will try my best to glorify you..." So here it is, a song of praise, in its own sense.</p> 
<br/> 
<p>In ANTHEM's first week, it has received over 15,000 downloads and ranks in the top 10 of the most downloaded themes for Firefox.</p>
