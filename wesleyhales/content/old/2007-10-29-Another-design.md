<p>The designer inside me just won't give up. I have tried and tried to put down the Photoshop paint brush and embrace development only, but it just isn't going to happen. I care just as much about semantic HTML and css/designer stuff as I do about hard core Java development. </p> 

<p>Some say it's easy to be a jack of all trades and a master of none. But I am naturally forced to slap that theory in the face and then kick it in the balls ;-)</p> 

<p>With that said, enjoy the new layout and be ready for another in a few months.</p>
