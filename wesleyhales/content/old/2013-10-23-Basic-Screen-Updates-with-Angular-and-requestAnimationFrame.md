## Overview
Some of the best known approaches for running a countdown or count-up timer in AngularJS are shown on JSFiddle using [setInterval](http://jsfiddle.net/IgorMinar/ZSBhg/2/) and
Angular's builtin [$timeout](http://jsfiddle.net/ganarajpr/LQGE2/).

Both approaches require the use of $scope.$apply, which is completely normal. It forces the page/bindings to update when a change
is made outside of the AngularJS lifecycle (like inside a setInterval or setTimeout).
If you want to read more about $scope.$apply check out [this article](http://jimhoskins.com/2012/12/17/angularjs-and-apply.html).

For this particular case, I need a countdown timer on the page. Basically it sits in the upper right hand corner of the page and lets
the user know when it's about to refresh the data.

I finally got a chance to analyze the performance of updating the page every second with a simple timer and couldn't believe how much jank it was causing.
There are a lot of good articles and videos explaining jank and how to debug, but Paul Irish made a really good short video and I advise you
 check it out [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSK70FwUz2A).

If we look at the frame rate on the recommended way of using setInterval, we see horrible performance:

Yep, That's 1 FPS spikes with a continuous stream of 9 frames per second. Ouch.

Also, if you look at the memory being consumed, we're taking quite a hit for this little counter.

We maintain around 25MB and then shoot up to 34 when the page does its refresh.

## rAF to the rescue!
I'm still trying to bring requestAnimationFrame into my dev thought process, and this was a fine chance to see if it could save the day.
Here's the code I put together:
<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/wesleyhales/59SeE/embedded/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>

And now, when we look at our frame rate in Chrome dev tools we get a fairly consistent 60 FPS:

Also the memory footprint is greatly reduced:

Cruising at 9.3MB instead of the 25MB we were getting before bringing in rAF.

A lot of the performance overhead is based on the AngularJS framework itself. It could be stuff I need to refactor and make better or it might just be the
framework lifecycle. I need to get a baseline on the AngularJS runtime before I can make any assumptions (or point fingers).
This is my first perf analysis of the framework and I plan on doing much more in the coming months.
