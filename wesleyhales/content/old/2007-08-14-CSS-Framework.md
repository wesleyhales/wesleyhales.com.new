<p>There are several possible ways to go about building a CSS framework. The framework I mention here is suited for myself and the group of developers I work with. It has proven successful on the past 3 projects I have been on. 
Once everyone knows about a base set of styles it's amazing how much more productive the team is. Not only do you have a "master" type of stylesheet to work from, everyone can edit the code and make changes faster because they are aware of the framework in use.</p> 

<p>Many UI folks use inline styles just to get a page marked up, or pixel perfect. But this actually hinders productivity and makes the developer almost double their work. We all know that when you're buried in a project and working away getting things done, it is much harder to come back and "fix" things. Some people may enjoy working like that, but as a project lead you constantly have to remind people to go back in and clean up their work and sometimes I end up doing it myself. And, if you are using inline styles, then you go back and fix them, other developers may have already added your style to a stylesheet and you may overlook it and duplicate the same style over and over again.</p> 

<p>Bottom line is, use a framework like the example below and life will be much easier ;)<p> 

<p>Here are a few examples of usage. This is a very lean and mean framework for managing widths and alignment. I'm not too concerned with zeroing out all of my html elements like p, table, td, ul, etc. That is a given and some sites differ due to legacy issues and crappy css code.

<p>You will find yourself cascading the styles on almost every element. The great thing is that you don't have to double-pane the css file and your xhmtl, you can get things done very fast and done correctly... the first go 'round. </p> 

<p>And the code...</p>
